responsive (think I got it - 4/2020) webserver for RGB LEDs.
Simple control of RGB LED's. (no fancy chip in LED)

Many thanks to NC22 for this fantastic color picker:https://github.com/NC22/HTML5-Color-Picker

It's work in progress.

Test: https://allday-3d.com//test_case/data/index.html


## TO DO

- write some software for the ESP8266 to recieve a status about the current color.
- Place the canvas (with the color picker) centered when width is less then.. 400px (for example)
- Make the input box so that an user can not type in it.
