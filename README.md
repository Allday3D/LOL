It's work in progress.

Test: https://allday-3d.com//test_case/data/index.html


## TO DO

- write some software for the ESP8266 to recieve a status about the current color.
- Place the canvas (with the color picker) centered when width is less then.. 400px (for example)
- Make the input box so that an user can not type in it.
